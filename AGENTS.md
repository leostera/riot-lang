# AGENTS Router

This file is the entrypoint for project-specific agent guidance. If you're looking for your scratch pad and todo list, look at ./TODO.md

The `AGENTS.md` files in this repo are maintained alongside the code and should be updated when behavior or contracts change.

Use it as a router: pick the most relevant existing AGENTS file before making changes.

## Fast Start Checklist

1. Identify the domain area.
2. Read the matching AGENTS file if one exists.
3. Implement changes.
4. Run required builds.
5. Update affected AGENTS files if behavior or contracts changed.

When comitting, always use conventional commits.
