(**
   Conversion from source-shaped type syntax to inference types.

   `Ast.core_type` is the type syntax retained in `Typ.Ast`; `Ast.Type.t` is the
   algebra manipulated by unification. This module is the boundary between
   those two representations.

   Create fresh solver variables for a declaration's type parameters.

   The returned scope is intended to be installed with `State.with_type_params`
   while converting the declaration body.

   Instantiate a record field lookup with fresh type parameters.

   Returns the concrete owner record type and the concrete field type for this
   lookup site.
