   Convert a hard-coded prelude name into the same structured identifier shape
   used for user-written names.

   This is intentionally the only string-to-path step in this module. Everywhere
   else works with `Ast.ident`, so the rest of the checker does not parse or
   split names by hand.

(* These identifiers are canonical names, not special type constructors. *)

let int_ident = ident "int"

(**
   Built-ins are represented as nominal applications with zero or more type
   arguments. That keeps them on the same path as user-defined abstract types:
   `int`, `bool`, and `string` are not separate variants in the type algebra.

let bool = make bool_ident

let float = make float_ident

let char = make char_ident

let string = make string_ident

let unit = make unit_ident

let list el = make list_ident ~arguments:[ el ]

(**
   Unit is special only because the source language exposes `()` as syntax, and
   earlier lowering represents that constructor through this canonical name.
