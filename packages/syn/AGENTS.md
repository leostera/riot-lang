# syn AGENTS

`syn` is the OCaml lexer, parser, CST, and diagnostics layer.

## Rules

1. Preserve lossless parsing. Token and trivia retention matter.
2. Parser recovery changes are user-facing because tooling builds on diagnostics.
3. Keep syntax tree changes coordinated with any tooling that consumes `syn`, especially `tusk-fix` and `tusk-eval`.
4. Prefer explicit syntax kinds and spans over inferred structure.
5. Keep `Syn.Cst` faithful to the successful `Ceibo` parse. If a syntax family cannot be lifted precisely, bail from the builder instead of introducing public placeholder nodes.
6. During the structural-formatting push, prefer exposing explicit CST facts for valid syntax over preserving formatter-policy convenience; if `krasny` still needs to reconstruct a fact, that fact likely belongs here.
7. Keep the CST root explicit about implementation vs interface files; do not collapse `.ml` and `.mli` structure into one ambiguous top-level shape.
8. Keep file-level item families split between `StructureItem` and `SignatureItem`; do not reintroduce a shared mixed top-level item enum.
9. Keep `cst.ml` focused on public types, `cst_builder.ml` focused on lifting, and `cst_json.ml` focused on fixture serialization.
10. Keep shared CST recursion in `visit.ml`; syntax consumers should not each reimplement their own expression and type walkers.
11. Keep parsing and CST construction split: `Parser.parse_*` and `Syn.parse*` return Ceibo trees plus diagnostics, while `Syn.build_cst` performs the explicit faithful lift.
12. Keep `Ceibo` sourced from `packages/ceibo`; do not reintroduce a vendored `packages/syn/src/ceibo` copy.
13. Keep pattern attributes orthogonal to pattern shape; attach them via `Pattern.attributes` instead of a `Pattern.Attribute` wrapper node.
14. Keep expression attributes orthogonal to expression shape; attach them via `Expression.attributes` instead of wrapper nodes or postfix-shell `Apply` artifacts.
15. Keep record-expression fields parsetree-like: always lift a field value expression, and preserve punning with explicit metadata instead of `None`.
16. Keep packed first-class module expressions direct: `Expression.ModulePack.module_expression` should be the packed payload itself, and any `: S` ascription should stay in explicit `package_type` fields instead of being rewritten as an inner `ModuleExpression.Constraint`.
16. Keep grouped declaration families recursive by construction. Use `and_binding` / `next_and_declaration` links on the owning node and expose flattened helper accessors such as `TypeDeclaration.and_declarations` only as read APIs; do not reintroduce separate mutual-group wrapper nodes.
17. Keep standalone top-level comments and docstrings explicit in the CST item stream; do not bury their ownership in enclosing declaration spans.
18. Keep nested `sig ... end` and `struct ... end` syntax-node lifts normalized the same way as file-level lifts; callers should not have to provide extra source text just to get correct trivia ownership.
19. Keep raw trivia ownership explicit on declaration nodes that can carry inline comments/docstrings, even before higher-level sequence normalization decides whether adjacent docstrings stay standalone or attach to a neighbor.
20. Keep token-attached trivia as the source of truth; do not reintroduce standalone trivia tree children in Ceibo.
21. Keep `Lexer.tokenize` emitting only real tokens plus `Token.EOF`, with trailing file trivia on `Token.EOF.leading_trivia`.
22. Keep `Parser.parse_result.tokens` as the original lexer token stream, and use that stream as the source of truth for file-level standalone trivia instead of re-lexing source text.
23. Keep parser-built green trees trivia-free in normal paths: parser control flow may still consume token-attached leading trivia explicitly, but green child arrays should represent trivia through token `leading_trivia`, not standalone trivia elements.
24. Keep top-level structure/signature doc ownership on one shared ordered-item pass; do not let those normalization rules fork by item family again.
25. Keep top-level standalone comment/doc ordering driven by token order: derive file items from each item’s first-token leading trivia plus `EOF.leading_trivia`, not by subtracting syntax-node spans from the file.
26. Keep nested `sig ... end` and `struct ... end` bodies exposed through shape-specific CST-node helpers such as `CstBuilder.signature_items_of_module_type` and `CstBuilder.structure_items_of_module_expression`; callers should not have to relift raw nested syntax anchors by hand just to get normalized item ownership, and wrong-shape requests should fail explicitly instead of returning `Ok None`.
27. Keep grouped `type ... and ...` ownership member-driven: normalize each member from its own `TYPE_DECL` token stream, then reassemble the public grouped declaration, instead of redistributing docs/headings out of the grouped parent node by source-span slicing.
28. Keep red traversal aligned with that same contract for parser-built trees: `SyntaxNode.children`, `direct_tokens`, and `tokens` should already be trivia-free, with comments/docstrings reachable through `SyntaxToken.leading_trivia`.
29. Keep member doc ownership leading-only: constructor docstrings in inter-member gaps should attach to the next constructor's `owned_trivia.leading`, while postfix comments may still bubble backward onto the previous constructor and terminal constructor docstrings stay standalone.
30. Keep record field doc ownership leading-only: field docstrings in inter-field gaps should attach to the next field's `owned_trivia.leading`, while postfix comments may still bubble backward onto the previous field and terminal `}`-owned docs/comments must be preserved without stealing them for the last field.
31. Keep explicit member-stream normalization limited to repeated member grammars with public member `owned_trivia` today: variant constructors and record fields. Exception declarations stay on the ordinary ordered-item path, and object type fields should not gain member-stream ownership rules until the CST gives them `owned_trivia` and a renderer contract.
32. Keep doc kind explicit on `Cst.Docstring`: section-vs-ordinary classification should be computed once during CST lift and then reused by ordered-item ownership and nested-body normalization, instead of being rediscovered from raw docstring text in normal paths.
33. Keep nested `sig ... end` and `struct ... end` helper item streams terminal-trivia-complete: standalone comments/docstrings that live on the closing token's `leading_trivia` must surface as final nested items, not be left for downstream source-gap recovery.
34. Keep nested `sig ... end` and `struct ... end` helper item streams built from token order, not child-gap archaeology: surface standalone comments/docstrings from each nested item's first-token `leading_trivia` plus the closing token's `leading_trivia`, then let the ordered-item pass normalize ownership exactly like the top level.
35. Keep grouped `type ... and ...` member-leading trivia sourced from the separator token stream during normalization: later members must inherit the `and` token's `leading_trivia` after raw-node owned-trivia recomputation, not via early lift-time patches that get overwritten.
36. Keep record-body helper streams public and token-order-complete: `CstBuilder.record_field_items_of_fields` must emit normalized `RecordField` items plus any remaining standalone `}`-owned comments/docstrings after field-owned spans are excluded, so downstream renderers never need raw record-node interleaving or closing-token recovery.
37. Keep `sig ... end` on an explicit `SIG_EXPR` syntax kind. Do not route signature module-type bodies back through `IDENT_EXPR` plus token-text sniffing in the parser or CST builder.
38. Keep `Cst.owned_trivia` public and explicit: `leading`, `inner`, and `trailing` are the stable CST ownership buckets consumed by `krasny` and CST JSON, not a temporary migration wrapper to hide behind source-gap recovery.
39. Keep optional parameter structure lossless in `Syn.Cst`: preserve typed binding patterns and `default_value` as real CST fields instead of forcing downstream tools to recover them from parameter source text.
40. Keep sequence separator structure explicit in `Syn.Cst`: `sequence_expression.separator_tokens` is the token-order-complete list of `;` boundaries. Do not duplicate per-step trivia into CST convenience fields when the same fact is already structurally reachable from the separator tokens plus neighboring expression nodes.
41. Keep binding-operator clause boundaries explicit in `Syn.Cst`: `binding_operator_binding.equals_token` and `let_operator_expression.in_token` must stay public so downstream renderers do not reconstruct `let*` / `and*` separators from subtree token scans or source text.
42. Do not keep payload relift helpers on the public surface while payloads are opaque-only. Consumers should treat `Cst.Payload.Opaque` as the whole contract.
43. If we ever want structured OCaml payloads again, add them back intentionally as a new CST contract instead of reviving syntax-node-anchor side channels.
44. Keep attribute and extension payloads opaque by default. Preserve their shell-local token slice as `Cst.Payload.Opaque` instead of guessing that the payload grammar is OCaml.
45. Keep split-sigil floating annotations payload-free during CST lift. Forms such as `[@@@foo]` and `[%%%foo]` must not misparse the trailing sigil token as raw payload text.
46. Keep explicit nested item-anchor helpers non-duplicating: once `item_syntax_nodes` already includes lifted floating-attribute siblings, downstream relift helpers must not split the same `TYPE_DECL` a second time.
47. Keep the optional leading `type` keyword explicit on `Cst.CoreType.Poly` via `type_keyword_token`. Downstream tools should not rescan raw poly-type tokens just to distinguish `type a. ...` from `'a. ...`.
48. Keep quoted-vs-bare `Cst.CoreType.Var` spelling explicit. Preserve the optional apostrophe on quoted vars via `sigil_token` instead of forcing downstream tools to infer `'a` vs `a` from raw token scans or ad hoc string rewriting.
49. Keep index-expression delimiters explicit on `Cst.index_expression`. Preserve the opening punctuation token sequence and closing token so downstream renderers can print `.[ ]`, `.( )`, and extended `.%( )` forms without raw token-text reconstruction.
50. Keep leading `+` / `-` explicit on signed int/float constants via `sign_token` when the constant node owns that sign, so downstream tools do not rescan literal syntax-node tokens just to preserve signed literal patterns.
51. Keep core-type alias binder spelling explicit on `Cst.CoreType.Alias`. Preserve the optional alias-variable apostrophe via `sigil_token` instead of forcing downstream tools to synthesize `'whole` from bare name text.
52. Keep named and optional parameter sugar decisions explicit in `Syn.Cst`. Preserve whether the binding name matches the label via `binding_name_matches_label` so downstream tools do not compare label text with binding-pattern identifiers to choose `~label` vs `~label:pattern`.
53. Keep token-level operator/name classification explicit on `Syn.Cst.Token`. Expose fixed operators, operator-like identifiers, and same-spelling token comparisons through helpers such as `fixed_operator`, `is_operator_like_name`, `is_identifier_like_name`, and `same_text` so downstream tools do not rescan raw token text for `|>`, `&&`, `||`, `mod`, or similar cases.
54. Keep token-owned trivia explicit on `Syn.Cst.Token` too. Downstream tools that need the original token-carried trivia should read `Token.leading_trivia` plus `trivia_of_syntax_trivia`, not ask parent CST nodes to duplicate those lists as convenience fields.
55. Keep top-level phrase separators explicit on `Syn.Cst.SourceFile`. Expose source-file `;;` spelling through `SourceFile.phrase_separator_tokens` so downstream renderers do not reach around the public CST root to scan direct source-file tokens by hand.
56. Keep source-file phrase-boundary ownership explicit too. Preserve per-item `trailing_phrase_separator_tokens` on implementation/interface roots so downstream renderers do not recompute `;;` attachment by scanning item spans after CST construction.
57. Keep `Pattern.PolyVariantInherit.type_path` free of the leading `#` sigil. Preserve `#color` and `#M.color` as ordinary identifier/module paths after the sigil so downstream renderers can print the `#` once structurally instead of recovering or duplicating it from token text.
58. Keep CST boundary-trivia access explicit when downstream tools still need token-attached leading trivia around body/branch boundaries. Use `Syn.Cst.leading_trivia_after`, `leading_trivia_before_node`, and `leading_trivia_after_token_before_node` instead of having formatters walk `Ceibo.Red.SyntaxNode.tokens` directly.
59. Keep generic token-body span access explicit in `Syn.Cst` too. If downstream tools need a node’s real-token span without leading trivia, expose that through `Syn.Cst.token_body_span` instead of having formatters scan `Ceibo.Red.SyntaxNode.tokens` themselves.
60. Keep diagnostics-only syntax-kind access explicit in `Syn.Cst` as well. If downstream tools only need a node kind for unsupported-shape reporting, expose that through `Syn.Cst.syntax_kind` and stringify it only at the edge instead of calling `Ceibo.Red.SyntaxNode.kind` directly.
61. When a keyword or separator defines a stable grammar boundary, preserve the original tokens first. Only add an explicit CST boundary field when the structure itself would otherwise be missing; do not duplicate token-owned trivia into convenience fields that downstream tools can already reach through CST-carried tokens and child nodes.
62. Keep class and class-type declaration shell modifiers explicit in `Syn.Cst`. Shortcut forms such as `class%foo [@foo] x = ...` and `class type%foo [@foo] t = ...` should expose their shell extension/attributes directly instead of forcing downstream tools to recover them from raw declaration syntax.
63. Keep class and class-type body helper streams token-order-complete just like records and objects. `CstBuilder.class_field_items_of_fields` and `class_type_field_items_of_fields` should surface trailing `end`-owned comments/docstrings so downstream renderers never need class-body archaeology.
64. Prefer valid-shape sums over `option * option` declaration records. `class` declarations should not be representable as “missing both type and body”, and the same tightening should happen for other shared declaration nodes when practical.
64. Keep `module` bindings split by file context. Implementation-side `module M = ...` forms belong on `ModuleStructure`; interface-side `module M : S` forms belong on `ModuleSignature`; grouped `module rec ... and ...` declarations should chain through `next_and_declaration` instead of a separate recursive wrapper node.
65. Keep `let_binding` pattern-first. Do not cache a parallel `binding_name` field alongside `binding_pattern`; simple binding names should be derived only when the pattern shape actually carries one.
66. Keep syntax-optional adornments as optional fields, not fake grammar branches. If attributes, annotations, or constraints are optional in the language, model them with `option` on the valid node shape instead of introducing branch constructors just for presence/absence.
67. Split class/object member definitions along real grammar alternatives. Concrete methods/values should require bodies and keep optional type annotations, while virtual methods/values should require types and forbid bodies; initializers should require bodies outright.
68. Keep expression type annotations and coercions on one explicit `Expression.TypeAscription` node with valid inner variants. Do not split ordinary `: t` away from `:> t` / `: t :> u` into parallel nullable record shapes again.
69. Keep `class` items split by file context. Structure-side `class ... = ...` forms belong on `ClassDefinition`; interface-side `class ... : ...` forms belong on `ClassDeclaration`; do not reintroduce a shared cross-context class node.
70. Keep CST invariants local to construction. Do not reintroduce a whole-tree post-construction validation walk on the hot `build_cst` path; builder helpers should construct valid nodes directly and enforce any remaining invariants at the point where the facts are available.
71. Keep nested `sig ... end` and `struct ... end` relift paths going through the same payload-node ordered-item builders as file-level lifts. Nested helper item streams must preserve inter-item comments/docstrings, not just declaration nodes.
72. Keep body/branch trivia token-owned when possible. Comments/docstrings after `->`, `=`, `in`, `then`, `else`, or an opening delimiter should stay reachable through the relevant CST-carried token plus the following child node instead of being copied into parallel trivia fields.
