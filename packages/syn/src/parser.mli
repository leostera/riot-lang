(**
   Streaming OCaml parser.

   The parser consumes a stable source slice, lexes it, streams syntax events
   into the lossless tree builder, and always returns a tree plus diagnostics.
   Callers should keep string/file/reader conversion at their boundary and pass
   `IO.IoVec.IoSlice.t` here so all token views can point back into the same
   source storage.

type file_kind = [ | `Implementation | `Interface]
(**
   Result of one parser run.

   `tokens` contains the raw token stream, including trivia. `tree` stores only
   significant token leaves in child arrays; each token leaf still references
   the raw range that covers its leading trivia.
