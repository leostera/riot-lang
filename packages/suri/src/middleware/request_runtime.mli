   {1 Request Timing Middleware}

   Adds an X-Runtime header to responses showing request processing time.

   {2 Quick Start}

   {[
     let app = Middleware.[
       runner;   (* Adds X-Runtime: 0.0234 *)
       logger;
       router routes;
     ]
   ]}

   {2 Output Format}

   The X-Runtime header contains the request duration in seconds with
   millisecond precision:

   {v X-Runtime: 0.0234 v}  (23.4 milliseconds)

   {2 Use Cases}

   - {b Client monitoring}: Clients can track API response times
   - {b Load balancer metrics}: HAProxy, nginx can log response times
   - {b Debugging}: Quick visibility into slow requests
   - {b APM integration}: Application Performance Monitoring tools

   {2 Example Response}

   {v
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   X-Runtime: 0.0156
   Content-Length: 42

   {"status": "ok", "data": [...]}
   v}

   {2 Placement}

   Place early in the stack to measure total request time:

   {[
     let app = Middleware.[
       runner;    (* Start timer *)
       logger;     (* This duration is included *)
       cors ~origins:["*"] ();
       router routes;
     ]
   ]}

   Or place later to measure only handler time:

   {[
     let app = Middleware.[
       logger;
       cors ~origins:["*"] ();
       runner;    (* Only measures handler + router *)
       router routes;
     ]
   ]} 
*)
(** {1 Middleware} *)
(**
   Request timing middleware.

   Measures request processing time and adds X-Runtime header.

   {[
     let app = Middleware.[
       runner;
       router routes;
     ]
   ]}

   {b Header format}: [X-Runtime: 0.0234] (seconds with 4 decimal places)

   {b Performance}: Minimal overhead (microsecond-level timing)
