(** Telemetry - Process-based dynamic event dispatching system

    Inspired by https://hexdocs.pm/telemetry/readme.html

    Start the telemetry server:
    {[
      let _ = Telemetry.start ()
    ]}

    Create events in your library:
    {[
      type Telemetry.event += BuildStarted of { package : string }

      Telemetry.emit (BuildStarted { package = "my-pkg" })
    ]}

    Attach handlers to consume events:
    {[
      Telemetry.attach "my-handler" (fun event ->
          match event with
          | BuildStarted { package } -> Log.info "Building %s" package
          | _ -> ())
    ]} *)

type event = ..
(** Extensible variant type for telemetry events. Any module can extend this
    with their own events. *)

val start : unit -> Miniriot.Pid.t
(** Start the telemetry server process. Returns the server's PID. Must be called
    before emitting events. *)

val emit : event -> unit
(** Emit a telemetry event. All attached handlers will receive it. *)

val attach : string -> (event -> unit) -> unit
(** Attach a named handler for telemetry events. The handler will be called for
    every emitted event. If a handler with the same name already exists, it will
    be replaced. *)

val detach : string -> unit
(** Detach a handler by name. *)

val detach_all : unit -> unit
(** Detach all handlers. Useful for testing. *)

val list_handlers : unit -> string list
(** List all attached handler names. *)

val stop : unit -> unit
(** Stop the telemetry server. Blocks until all pending events are processed.
    This is useful in tests to ensure all events have been handled before making
    assertions. *)
