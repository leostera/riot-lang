(**
   File-backed and inline snapshot assertions for [Std.Test].

   External snapshots compare a rendered value against an approved artifact on
   disk. When the approved artifact is missing or differs, the assertion
   writes a pending [*.expected.new] candidate and fails. Approved snapshots
   are never mutated by ordinary test execution.

   Pending candidates are recreated from the current assertion output every
   time the assertion runs, even when a stale pending file already exists.
   Existing pending files remain visible failures until they are approved or
   rejected.

   Non-fixture snapshots live under:

   {[
     .riot/snapshots/<package>/<suite>/<test>.expected
   ]}

   Fixture-backed snapshots live adjacent to the fixture input, replacing the
   input extension with [.expected].
