# riot-cli AGENTS

`riot-cli` owns command parsing, user-facing output, and the top-level build workflow.

## Rules

1. Keep the CLI thin. It should orchestrate, not duplicate planner or executor logic.
2. Prefer direct local calls into riot libraries over protocol-shaped wrappers.
3. User-facing messages should stay concise and actionable.
4. When adding commands, update completions and help output in the same change.
5. Built-in commands that own domain logic elsewhere should delegate into their package library.
6. Commands that touch build artifacts must resolve the workspace root and honor `[riot].target_dir` instead of assuming `_build` or `./target`.
7. Keep rule-oriented and diagnostic-oriented fix surfaces distinct: `--list-rules` should describe rules, while `--list-diagnostics` should describe diagnostic codes.
8. Keep `riot test` and `riot bench` on the build-once flow: build the workspace once, then delegate `run-tests [query]` / `run-benchmarks [query]` into every suite binary. Use `-p/--package` for package narrowing rather than CLI-side suite prefiltering.
9. Reserve stdout for command payloads (JSON, completion scripts, binary/test output that is the command result). Send CLI control output such as progress, status lines, and user-facing errors to stderr.
10. Build locks must be scoped to the effective build lane, not the whole workspace. If artifacts are split by profile and target, the lock should be too.
11. Package-scoped warnings and failures should be labeled with the package name exactly once; when replaying multiline compiler payloads, preserve the payload text after the first prefixed line instead of reindenting it.
12. `riot install` must reuse the normal streamed build path. Do not keep a silent private build loop in `install.ml`.
13. `riot install` must fail if promotion into the workspace root or `~/.riot/bin` fails. Do not print synthetic success after a failed promote.
14. CLI workspace commands should reject workspace load errors at the boundary instead of threading partial-workspace state through downstream request APIs.
15. `fix_cmd.ml` should parse `matches`, build a `Riot_fix.fix_request`, call `Riot_fix.fix`, and render the returned output/events. Do not delegate raw `matches` into `Riot_fix.Cli.run`.
16. `publish.ml` should parse `matches`, build a `Riot_publish.publish_request`, call `Riot_publish.publish`, and render publish events. Keep the combined publish command surface in `riot-publish`, not in `riot-deps`.
17. `login` and `logout` should stay thin auth-config commands. They manage `~/.riot/config.toml` through `Riot_model.User_config`; do not turn them into registry-discovery or profile-management commands while the main registry stays hardcoded.
18. `riot snapshots` owns repository-level snapshot review commands. Keep it focused on discovering pending `.expected.new` files, showing review diffs, and promoting or rejecting candidates; do not fold snapshot approval into `riot test`. When a TTY is attached, `riot snapshots review` should be interactive and prompt `[a]pprove / [r]eject / [i]gnore / [q]uit`; keep a non-interactive diff dump fallback for non-TTY use.
19. PM human output should only show `Fetching <pkg> <version>` for real download-start events. Cache-hit materialization events and `PackageResolvedForBuild` stay structured in JSON but should be silent in human mode.
20. `add`, `rm`, and `update` are thin package-management commands. Parse flags into `Riot_deps` request types, delegate, and reuse the normal PM event renderer instead of inventing a second lock/progress surface.
21. `riot add` should accept named registry specs, local path specs, and GitHub source specs. Keep the CLI help text and errors honest about the accepted forms, but keep package-name discovery and Git materialization inside `riot-deps`.
22. Outside a workspace, `riot add` may bootstrap a minimal root workspace (`riot.toml` + `riot.lock`) and then route the first add through the workspace root manifest. `riot rm` and `riot update` should stay no-op/user-guidance commands in that case rather than failing with the generic workspace error.
23. `riot test` selectors should treat `package:suite` as suite discovery narrowing, not as a raw per-test substring. Only the remaining query text should be forwarded into `run-tests`.
24. `riot search` should stay workspace-independent. Parse flags in the CLI, delegate to `Riot_deps.search`, and keep stdout reserved for the search results themselves.
25. Keep `Riot_cli.Cli.run` reusable for in-process benches and tools. One-time runtime bootstrapping belongs in `initialize_runtime`, not in every embedded caller loop.
26. Keep workspace scans and `~/.riot` setup lazy. Built-in commands that do not need workspace state or riot-home state should not pay for them during startup.
27. `add` / `rm` / `update` should consume the same shared `Riot_model.Event` PM stream that builds use. Do not duplicate JSON or human rendering logic for package-management-only wrapper events in the command modules.
28. `riot upgrade` stays workspace-free and should reuse the published Riot release archive path plus release metadata JSON from `cdn.pkgs.ml/riot/latest.json` and `cdn.pkgs.ml/riot/riot-<version>.json`. Keep the UX concise, compare the downloaded binary with the installed one before replacing it, write `~/.riot/release.json` for installed metadata, and avoid delegating user-visible control flow to `install.sh`.
29. `riot --version` and `riot version` should prefer installed release metadata when available and render both the release id and build sha. Keep fallback output explicit for dev builds without installed metadata.
30. `riot lsp` must stay a thin delegate into `riot-lsp`, and it must keep stdout protocol-only. Do not run the normal stdout logger/runtime bootstrap for that command.
31. `riot toolchain list-available` stays workspace-free and should render data from `Riot_toolchain.list_available_toolchains` without scanning the workspace first.
32. `riot clean` is the normal workspace-wide cache-GC entrypoint and `riot clean --force` is the destructive build-root wipe. Keep the command thin: resolve the workspace at the CLI boundary once and delegate the maintenance policy to `riot-store`.
33. `riot doc --json` should emit JSONL payloads on stdout only. When `riot run` launches a child command with `--json` in its forwarded args, the wrapper should switch its own build/run progress output to JSON too so the combined stream stays machine-readable.
34. `Riot_cli.Cli.run` should stamp the default `X-Riot-Agent` value early through the `pkgs-ml` client API so downstream registry and CDN clients emit Riot version metadata consistently. Keep `RIOT_AGENT_HEADER` available as an override for automation that shells out to `riot` and needs a different identity.
35. Workspace resolution for build-facing commands should go through `Workspace_manager.scan` directly so detached single-package manifests can synthesize a one-package workspace. Do not prefilter those invocations with a separate "workspace root only" check.
36. `riot install` resolves targets in this order: local workspace binary, remote source, registry package. `riot run` resolves in this order: local workspace binary, remote source. Keep the target parsing and fallback policy in the CLI, including `-p/--package` disambiguation for local binaries, but delegate the actual external load/build/install/run work into `riot-build`.
37. `--local` is only for workspace-binary installs. Do not silently reinterpret `riot install --local <remote-or-registry-target>` as a global install.
38. `riot run` and `riot install` should allow omitting `<name>` when the current workspace or detached package has exactly one normal runnable binary. If multiple runnable binaries exist, keep the ambiguity explicit and require a binary name or `--package`.
39. `riot run <remote-source>` and `riot install <remote-source>` should reuse a cached source checkout by default. Surface `--update` as the explicit opt-in refresh path instead of fetching on every invocation.
<<<<<<< HEAD
40. `riot test` should run suites in JSON mode and reconstruct the human view from the parsed results. Suppress suites whose parsed summary has zero matching cases so substring queries do not leak `running 0 tests`, but keep the human output in the familiar per-suite pretty shape plus one unified case-level summary at the end, including measured test timing stats, the slowest matched test cases, and an explicit failed-test list. `riot test --json` should carry the same aggregated failure list on the final `TestSummary` event.
41. `riot bench` should render benchmark measurements from parsed structured suite results, not by scraping suite-local pretty output. Keep the final summary case-level (`completed`/`skipped`/`failed`) across the matched benchmark cases.
42. `riot yank` must require an exact `<package>@<version>` target, refuse to run without a saved pkgs.ml token, and prompt for interactive confirmation before sending the registry request.
43. `riot test --json` and `riot bench --json` should keep structured timing monotonic. Use `emitted_at_us` for generic build/progress events and `started_at_us` / `completed_at_us` / `duration_us` for suite lifecycle events instead of wall-clock timestamps.
44. `riot check` should resolve explicit file and directory arguments against the process cwd before workspace/package lookup so relative paths keep the same package context as absolute paths.
45. `riot build` should exit when the build is done. Do not hide synchronous post-build type-cache warmups or second workspace-preparation passes behind the build command.
