# riot-store AGENTS

`riot-store` owns the artifact cache and its on-disk layout.

## Rules

1. Treat manifest layout and hash addressing as compatibility-sensitive.
2. Keep writes atomic where practical. Partial cache entries are worse than misses.
3. Store logic should not know about CLI or session behavior.
4. Cache roots and export manifests are scoped by build lane (`profile` + `target`); do not assume host-default cache paths when serving cross-build artifacts.
5. Artifact manifests must preserve cached `ocamlc_warnings` so package warnings can be replayed without rebuilding.
6. Package exports now live in the hash-addressed artifact `manifest.json`. Do not reintroduce a second payload manifest for package exports.
7. Do not add package-name export lookup scans over the cache. Callers should hold the build result or hash they need and derive export paths from that explicit data.
8. Cache GC and generation receipts live here. Keep the fast path cheap: deciding whether GC runs should rely on small workspace-level metadata first, and only read generation receipt bodies when a GC pass is actually needed.
9. The first cache-GC rollout is workspace-wide, not lane-local. Receipt retention and size accounting span all lanes under the workspace build root together.
10. Keep `riot-store` Riot-specific. Generic content-addressable directory and bundle primitives belong in `contentstore`; `riot-store` should layer package artifacts, manifests, and lane policy on top.
11. Post-build generation recording must stay cheap on repeated warm builds. If a successful build produces the same normalized lane closure as the newest recorded generation and adds no new cache entries, dedupe that receipt instead of writing another identical newest generation file.
