(** Execute a single planned action node.

    This low-level primitive is used by higher-level schedulers that need
    explicit control over global readiness/dispatch policy (for example,
    workspace-level action scheduling).

    [completed] is the dependency result table for the action graph this node
    belongs to; it is consulted to implement dependency-failure skipping.

    Source staging supports both package-relative and workspace-relative source
    paths to stay compatible with serialized plans loaded from cache. *)

(** Execute an action graph with dependency-aware parallelism.

    Passing `concurrency = 1` uses the same code path with serialized
    execution.

    The executor performs cache lookup/save per action node hash and emits
    action telemetry events scoped to the provided `session_id`. *)
