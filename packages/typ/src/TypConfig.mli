(** Default host configuration used by the current prototype and tests.

    The default keeps [prelude] limited to language-level intrinsics and seeds
    a small set of bootstrap module summaries through [loaded_modules]. Those
    seeded summaries are a temporary stand-in for real persisted module exports
    and intentionally flow through the same [ModuleSummary] boundary that hosts
    will later hydrate from cache or build outputs. *)
