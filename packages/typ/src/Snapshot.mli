type t

(** Build a snapshot from the current session sources.

    Analyses are prepared lazily per source and only forced by queries that
    actually need them. Before the final per-source analysis runs, the snapshot
    may synthesize an ambient environment from sibling source exports so
    implicit file modules can participate in name resolution. *)

(** Monotonic session revision captured by this snapshot. *)
val revision: t -> int

(** Enumerate all per-source analyses in this snapshot.

    Calling this forces every lazy per-source analysis. *)

(** Find the analysis for one logical source within this snapshot.

    Calling this forces analysis only for the requested source. *)
