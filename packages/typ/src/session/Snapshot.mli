(** Immutable analysis view over one [Session] revision. *)
type t

(** Build a rooted snapshot from the current session sources.

    Analyses are prepared lazily per source and only forced by queries that
    actually need them. Before the final per-source analysis runs, the snapshot
    may synthesize an ambient environment from sibling source exports and
    host-loaded module typings so implicit file modules can participate in
    name resolution. *)
val make: revision:int -> roots:SourceId.t list -> config:TypConfig.t -> sources:Source.t list -> t

(** Monotonic session revision captured by this snapshot. *)
val revision: t -> int

(** Root sources this snapshot was prepared for. *)
val roots: t -> SourceId.t list

(** Enumerate all per-source analyses in this snapshot.

    Calling this forces every lazy per-root analysis. *)
val analyses: t -> SourceAnalysis.t list

(** Enumerate the in-memory export summaries for every source in this snapshot.

    Calling this forces every lazy per-root analysis. *)
val file_summaries: t -> FileSummary.t list

(** Enumerate the canonical host-facing module typings for every rooted module in this
    snapshot.

    When a rooted module has both [.ml] and [.mli] sources in the session, the
    returned typings are paired and interface-shaped. Calling this forces every
    lazy per-root analysis needed to produce those canonical module typings. *)
val module_typings: t -> ModuleTypings.t list

(** Find the canonical host-facing module typings for one rooted source's
    module, when present.

    This preserves the rooted query boundary while ensuring callers see the
    same canonical [ModuleTypings] that [module_typings] enumerates for that
    module. *)
val find_module_typings: t -> SourceId.t -> ModuleTypings.t option

(** Find the analysis for one logical source within this snapshot.

    For paired [.ml]/[.mli] modules, the returned analysis includes any
    signature-inclusion diagnostics derived from comparing the implementation
    against the interface. Calling this forces analysis only for the requested
    root source and any same-module siblings needed to pair it. *)
