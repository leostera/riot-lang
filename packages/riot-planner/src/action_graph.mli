(** Create an empty action graph *)
type t

val create: unit -> t

(**
   Compute content-based hash of an action node as part of a Merkle graph.

   If two action nodes have the same hash, they will produce identical outputs.
   This enables caching: if we find a cached node with matching hash, we can
   skip execution and copy its outputs from the cache.

   The hash includes (forming a Merkle graph):
   1. All actions in the node (sources, flags, includes, etc.)
   2. Source file contents (hashed)
   3. Expected outputs (paths only, since contents don't exist yet)
   4. Hashes of all dependency nodes (recursive Merkle property)

   This means if ANY source file changes OR any dependency changes, the hash
   changes, invalidating the cache for this node and all downstream nodes.
*)
val hash_action_node: t -> Action_node.t -> Crypto.hash

(**
   Map a module graph to an action graph and collect all outputs.

   Each module node is transformed into an action node containing the
   actions needed to build that module. The graph structure (dependencies)
   is preserved, so the action graph mirrors the module graph.

   Returns (action_graph, all_outputs) where all_outputs is the complete
   list of files produced by all actions.

   This enables parallelization analysis: nodes without dependencies
   between them can be built in parallel.

(**
   Convert action graph to JSON with sorted nodes for deterministic output.

   The JSON representation is used as a persisted plan artifact for warm builds.
   It includes node-level package path context and the precomputed node hash so
   cache-key identity is stable across process boundaries.
*)
val to_json: t -> Data.Json.t

(**
   Reconstruct action graph from JSON for warm-build execution.

   This function preserves each node's serialized hash and package path
   metadata rather than recomputing them. Recomputing can diverge from the
   original Merkle graph and break action-cache lookup.
